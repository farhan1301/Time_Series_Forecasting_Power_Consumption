Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost and Prophet

This repository contains implementations for forecasting time series data using two powerful approaches: XGBoost and Prophet. Our projects focus on energy consumption forecasting using the PJME hourly energy dataset, showcasing different methodologies to tackle time series prediction challenges.

The repository is divided into two main sections:

XGBoost for Time Series Forecasting: Demonstrates forecasting using the gradient boosting framework XGBoost, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Prophet for Time Series Forecasting: Uses Facebook's Prophet model to forecast time series data, emphasizing its ease of use and automatic handling of seasonality and trends.
